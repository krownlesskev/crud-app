# CRUD APP

I started this project to learn more about the MERN Stack.

The front end is developed with `React`, with plans to implement `material UI`.
I would love to use `react-bootstrap` as it is seemingly more lightweight, however with `React@18` and `react-bootstrap`'s
latest version, there is a compile error that does not have a fix yet.

The backend stack will consist of custom API endpoints written in `Node.js`.
For the middleware, we will be using `express`.
and for the database we will be using `mongoDB`'s atlas.

`Live Demo will be up soon..`
